**Responsive Web Design Certification - freeCodeCamp**

## Project Description
This repository documents my learning progress in the **Responsive Web Design** certification from freeCodeCamp. This project represents my initial steps in mastering clean and semantic web structures.

## Project 1: Cat Photo App
This project demonstrates fundamental HTML5 skills with a focus on multimedia content, hyperlinking, and text organization.

### Key Features & Code Implementation:
* **Semantic Elements**: Utilized `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<figure>` to create a meaningful document structure.
* [cite_start]**Media & Accessibility**: Implemented `<img>` tags with appropriate `src` attributes and descriptive `alt` text (e.g., "A cute orange cat lying on its back")[cite: 5, 6].
* [cite_start]**Hyperlinks**: Created external links using `<a>` tags with `href` attributes and `target="_blank"` to ensure links open in new tabs[cite: 6].
* **Structured Lists**: Organized content using Unordered Lists (`<ul>`) for cat interests and Ordered Lists (`<ol>`) for cat dislikes.
* **Typography**: Applied `<em>` and `<strong>` elements within `<figcaption>` to add emphasis to captions.
